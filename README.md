## 📖 Overview

**Calistto** is a B2B SaaS landing page designed to convert high-net-worth clients in specialized industries. It is not just a brochure; it is a demonstration of technical superiority.

The site is built on the **"Obsidian-Glow" Design System**, fusing deep enterprise stability ("Abyss Navy") with active AI intelligence ("Neon Cyan" & "Sunset Gold"). It features advanced scroll-linked animations, dynamic particle physics, and a modular architecture optimized for SEO and LLM crawlability.

### 🎯 Key Business Verticals
1.  **Real Estate AI:** Predictive CRM & Lead Scoring (targeting the Egyptian market).
2.  **Yachting Logic:** Fleet logistics & brokerage automation.
3.  **Financial Intelligence:** Algorithmic value investing (powering *Nour Borsa*).

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Active Intelligence Stream
An infinite-scroll marquee component that showcases live deployments (e.g., *Nour Borsa*, *Real Estate CRM*) to provide immediate social proof.

### 2. The "Calistto Engine"
A technical visualization section using SVG path animations to demonstrate the backend infrastructure (VPS, Nginx, PostgreSQL) powering the SaaS solutions.

### 3. Dynamic Particle Contact
The `/contact` page features a lightweight, interactive particle network that responds to mouse movement, creating an energetic "final impression" for potential clients.

### 4. LLM-Optimized SEO
Semantic HTML and injected JSON-LD schemas ensure that LLMs (ChatGPT, Perplexity) correctly associate "Calistto" with "AI Software Development in Egypt" and "Super Full Stack Engineering."
